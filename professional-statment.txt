Through my coursework in Googleâ€™s Cybersecurity Fundamentals, I developed hands-on skills in network security and incident response. I participated in Capture the Flag competitions, where I gained practical experience in detecting vulnerabilities and securing systems. This experience, combined with my strong problem-solving abilities, has driven my passion for cybersecurity and prepared me to take the next step in my career.
